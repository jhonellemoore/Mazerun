Maze Run, a video game which features a unique character who trails through a complex maze in hopes of getting across 
this challenging network of paths to get away from looming zombies and escape the dangers of wandering obstacles and barriers. 
The aim of the game is to get the userâ€™s character across the complex maze safely, as well as race against the 60 second clock to 
complete the maze in the shortest time period. MazeRun combines competition with intuition and ensures that players get hooked after just 
one round of intense play.
